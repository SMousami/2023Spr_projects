# Mosquitoes in a room 
## A monte carlo simulation of how to repell and kill mosquitoes in a room. 

I have found myself in situations throughout my life where I was in a room full of mosquitoes, plotting ways to kill the most number of them in a shorter span of time. I draw inspiration from these moments in life to work on this project.

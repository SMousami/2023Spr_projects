# Mosquitoes in a room 
## A monte carlo simulation of how to repell and kill mosquitoes in a room.

I have found myself in situations throughout my life where I was in a room full of mosquitoes, plotting ways to kill the most number of them in a shorter span of time. I draw inspiration from these moments in life to work on this project.

### Setting

The experiment will see how effective vaporizers are in killing mosquitoes. 

### Parameters

1) Number of mosquitoes : randomly generated
2) Room orientation and size
3) mosquito positions and movement
4) Diffusion of vaporizer through the room

## Hypothesis

1) The orientation of the room matters for the vaporizer to be effective. The vaporizer works better in a square room instead of a rectangular room. 
2) The presence of a ceiling fan in the room will increase the diffusion rate of vaporizer and improve its effectiveness in killing mosquitoes.

## Monte Carlo simulation

Any experiment with a monte carlo simulation has three phases

1) Designing a simulation
2) Validating the simulation
3) Experiments and predictions

# Mosquito Vaporizers: Buy or Pass? 
## A Monte Carlo Simulation of Mosquito Vaporizer effectiveness in a room full of mosquitoes. 

Mosquitoes are small, flying insects that can cause significant harm to humans and animals. They are known to carry and transmit various diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus, which can be life-threatening. Mosquito bites can also cause itching, swelling, and irritation, leading to discomfort and potential infection. In addition to their impact on human health, mosquitoes can also harm the environment by disrupting food chains and ecosystems. Despite efforts to control their populations through measures such as insecticide spraying and removing standing water sources, mosquitoes remain a persistent problem in many parts of the world. (2)

In countries like India, there are many companies which advertize and sell machines that release vapours in the air to kill mosquitoes. They claim these liquid vaporizers to be an effective way of killing mosquitoes in an indoor settings.

In India, the number of people who contract one of the diseases transmitted through mosquitoes runs annually in millions. Personally, I have often found myself in a room full of mosquitoes, and really prayed that the vaporizer machine would work as it claims. This project is one such work to understand the working of the vaporizer and if it would actually be beneficial. The Monte Carlo simulation utilized in the project aims to study in detail how effective vaporizers are in killing mosquitoes in an indoor room setting.

## Design

#### Mosquito
A random number of mosquito is assumed to exist in the room for every simulation. The random number is between 20 to 50 to replicate real world situations.
These mosquitoes are spread through out the room and their initial position is also randomly determined. All the mosquitoes are randomly moved a distance (or not) such that they are not in the same position throughout the simulation run. The mosquitoes inhale the vapours that the vaporizer emits, and their position in the room determines how much vapours they have inhaled at any point of time. The mosquitoes have a threshold of inhalation of the vapours, after which they die due to having too much vapours in their system. 

#### Setting
The setting is that of an indoor room. The room is divided into sections along it's length. The vaporizer can be present in any of these sections and emits a steady flow of vapours into the air. The vapours diffuse through the air throughout the rooms. For the sake of simplicity, the room's sections have the same concentration in every point of the section. The vapours also loose their effectiveness after 30 mins of being in the air. 


## Validation

To validate the design, the following study was used to understand what the results should be in a room of dimensions 6.8 * 3.4 * 2.7. The study had gotten a knockout rate of 56.7% with an interal of 7.3%.(1) The Monte carlo simulation gives similar results when the room length is 7 units, the fan flow is really low and there is only one vaporizer in the room. When this simulation is ran 1000 times, it gives a statistically convergent plot shown below. Note: The below figure shows the survival rate, which is 1 - knockout rate. Hence the average knockout rate should be around 57 % knockout rate.

To validate the settings of the research above, having a mosquito threshold level of 70 units made sense. However for the sake of further experiments and demonstrations of results, the mosquito inhalation threshold will be set at 100, as 70 threshold is too low to conduct meaningful experiments before all the mosquitoes die.

## Experiments

#### Hypothesis 1: The orientation of the room has an effect on the vaporizer. 

Assumptions: 
1) Fan speed will be kept at a minimum speed of 0.3 (0 is the lowest and 0.5 is highest)
2) There will be only one vaporizer in the corner most section of the room.
3) The experiment will run for 180 minute
4) The diffusion rate of the vaporizer is 0.2 units per minute. 
5) We are placing vaporizers on one of the walls of the room. In this experiment, we will consider volume into account and try to factor it into diffusion values to work with the current structure. Assuming a 8 (L) * 6 (W)* 10 (H), we can consider two orientations: 
  a) 8 sections where the vaporizer is place on the shorter side (6 width wall) 
  b) 6 sections where the vaporizer is placed on the longer wall (8 length wall)
In case a), the diffuser emits to a volume of 6 * 1 * 1 in each section (8 sections), in case b), the vaporizer emits to a volume of 8 * 1 * 1 in 6 sections. 
The adjusted concentrations in section a) will be normalized to a factor of 1/6 and 1/8 for section b).
Taking this into account, our normalized emission rates for each section is :
  a) 8 sections > 100 (baseline)
  b) 6 sections > 100*6/8 = 75

#### Hypothesis 2: The presence of a ceiling fan in the room will improve vaporizer's effectiveness in killing mosquitoes.

Assumptions: 
1) The length of the room is 10 units
2) The fan speed will be vaired for each experiment run
3) There will be two different experiments, one with just one vaporizer, another with two vaporizers. 
4) The time interval for the simulations will be 180 min

##### Scene 1: Two vaporizers at either end of the room

Fan speed = 0, averge survival rate =

Fan Speed = 0.3, averge survival rate = 39%

Conclusion: Fan speed decreases the survival rate at first, but then normalizes as the fan speed reaches the top speed. 

#### Hypothesis 3: 
#Assumptions

#Hypothesis


### Setting

The experiment will see how effective vaporizers are in killing mosquitoes. 

### Parameters

1) Number of mosquitoes : randomly generated
2) Room orientation and size
3) mosquito positions and movement
4) Diffusion of vaporizer through the room

## Hypothesis

1) The orientation of the room matters for the vaporizer to be effective. The vaporizer works better in a square room instead of a rectangular room. 
2) The presence of a ceiling fan in the room will increase the diffusion rate of vaporizer and improve its effectiveness in killing mosquitoes.

## Monte Carlo simulation

Any experiment with a monte carlo simulation has three phases

1) Designing a simulation
2) Validating the simulation
3) Experiments and predictions
